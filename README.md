This is a simulation of a park by which I can study the OOT in-depth.
As a student, we have not so much software project to participate in, so deveoping such a small project seems a good way for me to study the OOT.

If you want to know more about this project, you may need to read the requirement in requirement.pdf.
In this project, I use the Java language.
All software process was done by myself, so there exists so many problems and weaknesses.
Welcome to communicate with me and give my some suggestion.
Hope your suggesion! Thank you.

The comment in the source code and design document are written in Chinese. So Proficiency in Chinese is needed.
